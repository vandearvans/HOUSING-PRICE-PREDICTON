Title: Boston Housing Price Prediction

Overview:
This project uses the classic Boston Housing dataset to predict median house values (MEDV) in various Boston suburbs. The dataset contains 14 attributes such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, and proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.

Objectives:

Load and preprocess a real-world dataset (handle missing values, scale features).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable relationships.

Build and evaluate a regression model to predict house prices.

Methods:

Python (Google Colab) with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

scikit-learn for machine learning:

Split data into training and testing sets.

Impute missing values and scale features using a pipeline.

Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.

Evaluate the model using R² score.

Results:
The trained model outputs predicted median house prices for unseen data and achieves a reasonable R² score on the test set (indicating how well the model explains variance in house prices).
