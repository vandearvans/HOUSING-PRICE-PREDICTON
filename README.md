# 🏡Housing Price Prediction

> Predicting house prices using machine learning on a classic real-world dataset

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting **median house prices (MEDV)** in different Boston suburbs using the **Boston Housing dataset**.  
The dataset includes **14 influential features** such as:

- 🏙️ Crime rate  
- 🏠 Average number of rooms  
- 🧾 Property tax rate  

- 🌳 Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots  

The goal is to understand how these factors affect housing prices and build a reliable regression model.

## 🎯 Objectives

✔ Load and preprocess a real-world dataset  
✔ Handle missing values efficiently  
✔ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns  
✔ Build a regression model to predict house prices  
✔ Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Split data into **training** and **testing** sets  
- Handle missing values using **imputation**  
- Normalize features using **scaling**  
- Combine preprocessing steps using **Pipeline**

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize feature distributions  
- Analyze correlations between variables  
- Identify key features influencing house prices  

### 3️⃣ Model Building
- Train a **Linear Regression** model  
- Predict median house prices (MEDV)

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Evaluate performance using **R² Score**
- Measure how well the model explains price variance
